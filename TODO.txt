TODO
====

- Possible create 'nicer' exceptions based on a base transmogrifier exception

- Create default utility sections:

  - construction (should take care of delayed cataloging, memory management,
    etc.)

  - workflow management

  - 'path' creation (insert Folders into the pipeline wherever required)

  - references

- Create a not-so-naive version of the splitter with look-ahead condition
  testing and extra-items-inserted detection.

- Think about general option parsing support; many sections will be
  configurable with a list of keys to operate on, and perhaps some sort of
  patter matching will be needed. Supporting this would be the work of a
  module in collective.transmogrifier.
  
- Provide a UI for selecting and running pipelines

- Define a 'default import pipeline' variable in the transmogrifier section,
  so you can include a default set of sections that'll work for 95% of the
  transmogrifier import cases. The goal is to have a pipeline definition like
  this::

    pipeline =
        my.specific.import.section
        ${transmogrifier:importpipeline}
